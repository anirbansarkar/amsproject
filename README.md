Alumni Management System

This project is aimed at developing a Repository and each Engine for alumni of the college, which is of importance to a college. The Alumni Information System is a offline based JAVA application that can be accessed 24X7 without any internet connection. Authorized persons can access the search Engine to know about any Alumni of the college. 


This system can be used as an application for the Alumni Information System to manage the information about the alumni of the college. The Alumni members form an integral part of the college, so it is very important to have their database. This application will maintain information like year of passing, name, current working status and so on of the alumni. Searches can be made to find out the alumni based on their year of passing, current location and current work status. This will help to keep a relation between the institution and the  college.
